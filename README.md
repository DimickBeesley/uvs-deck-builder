## Problem Statement
While it provides all the necessary functionality, the current website used
for deck building (uvsultra) is unappealing and difficult to work with. Therefore, we 
are going to redesign the deck builder interface to make it more attractive 
and usable.

## Purpose and Scope
The purpose is to serve as a proof of concept for an alternative to uvsultra
(https://www.uvsultra.online/index.php)

The functionality we wish to reach as of now consists of 3 things. 
- browse the database of cards with filtering
- browse the list of all decks that have been made
- edit, create, or delete an existing deck
